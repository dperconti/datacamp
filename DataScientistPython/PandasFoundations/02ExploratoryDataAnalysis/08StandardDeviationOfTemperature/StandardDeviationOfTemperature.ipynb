    "In this exercise, you're going to compare the distribution of daily temperatures in January and March. You'll compute the mean and standard deviation for these two months. You will notice that while the mean values are similar, the standard deviations are quite different, meaning that one month had a larger fluctuation in temperature than the other.\n",
